# What is a Astra Project ?
**ASTRA is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to detect the geographic location of an Instagram user's posts. Utilizing the Picarta API, it analyzes photos shared by the target user to extract geographical clues. The program downloads the user's posts and examines their EXIF data for GPS coordinates. If EXIF data is unavailable, Picarta's AI algorithms assess the image content to estimate possible locations.** <br/>

# Model's accuracy

**The confidence value represents how certain the model is about its prediction. For example, a confidence score above 0.9000 indicates that the model is highly confident in the accuracy of its prediction, suggesting a higher likelihood that the result is correct. Conversely, lower confidence values, such as 0.534, imply that the model is less certain and the prediction is less reliable. The higher the confidence value, the more accurate the model's prediction is likely to be. However, it's important to note that the model does not always provide 100% accurate results. The accuracy can vary depending on factors like the clarity of the photo and the location where it was taken. The model does not always provide 100% accurate results.
